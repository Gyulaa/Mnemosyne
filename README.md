# Mnemosyne

A private app that runs on your computer to organize family photos and build a family tree — complete with face recognition, documents, notes, and a fully interactive tree view.

No account, no cloud, no subscription. Everything stays on your machine.

# For users

## What is Mnemosyne?

Mnemosyne (pronounced *"neh-MO-zih-nee"*) is a desktop application for families who want to keep their photos and genealogy in one place — privately, on their own computer.

You point it at a folder of photos, and it automatically finds and groups faces. You then name the people it found, connect them to your family tree, attach documents (birth certificates, letters, old photos), write notes, and build a complete family history.

**Nothing is ever uploaded anywhere.** The app works entirely offline.

---

## System requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | Windows 10 or newer (64-bit) |
| **macOS** | macOS 11 Big Sur or newer |

No Python, no Node.js, no technical setup needed — just download and run.

---

## Installation

1. Go to the [**Releases**](../../releases) page on GitHub
2. Download the file for your computer:
   - **Windows** → `Mnemosyne-windows.zip`
   - **Mac** → `Mnemosyne-mac.zip`
3. Unzip the downloaded file
4. **Windows**: open the unzipped folder and double-click `Mnemosyne.exe`
   **Mac**: open the unzipped folder, double-click `Mnemosyne.app`

> **Mac note:** On first launch macOS may say the app "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." If that happens, right-click (or Control-click) the app and choose **Open** — then click Open again in the dialog that appears. You only need to do this once.

The app opens in your browser automatically (at `http://localhost:7842`). The browser tab is the user interface — don't close the terminal/icon that launched it.

---

## Getting started

When you open Mnemosyne for the first time, you'll see a mostly empty screen. Here's how to get going:

### Step 1 — Choose a folder to scan

1. Click the **Scan** tab at the top
2. Click **Choose folder** and select the folder where your photos are stored
3. Click **Start scan**

On the very first scan, the app downloads a face-recognition model (~300 MB). This is a one-time download — it won't happen again.

Scanning can take a while for large photo libraries. You can close and reopen the app at any time; it will continue from where it left off.

### Step 2 — Name the people

1. Click **Run clustering** (after scanning finishes) to group similar faces together
2. Go to the **Clusters** tab
3. You'll see groups of face thumbnails — each group represents one person
4. Click a group and type the person's name

### Step 3 — Build your family tree

1. Click the **Genealogy** tab
2. Click **Add person** to create a family member
3. Use the person panel on the right to fill in names, birth and death dates, and relationships (parents, children, spouses)
4. To connect a person to their face cluster from the photo library, use the **Link cluster** button in their profile

From here you can also attach documents, write notes with citations, and find the relationship path between any two people.

## Updating

Mnemosyne can update itself automatically. Here's how:

1. When you open the app, it quietly checks if a new version is available (after about 5 seconds)
2. If an update is found, a small **colored dot** appears on the cloud icon in the top-right corner of the header
3. Click the cloud icon to open the update window
4. Click **Download update** and wait for it to finish (you can keep using the app while it downloads)
5. Click **Apply & Restart** — the app will close, update itself, and reopen

**Your family tree, photos, and settings are completely safe.** The update process copies your data to the new version before making any changes.

If you prefer to check for updates manually, go to **Settings** (gear icon, top right) → turn off **Auto-check on startup** → then click the cloud icon whenever you want to check.

---

## Your data

- **Your source photos are never modified.** Mnemosyne only reads them; it never moves, renames, or changes the original files.
- **Nothing leaves your computer.** The app works fully offline. The only network connection it makes is to check for updates on GitHub (and that can be turned off).
- All your data (family tree, notes, documents) is stored in a folder called `projects/` next to the app. You can back it up by simply copying that folder.

## Auto-update (implementation detail)

The updater module lives in `backend/updater.py`. It runs as a state machine:

```
idle → checking → up_to_date
                → update_available → downloading → ready → applying
any  → error
```

State is held in a module-level dict (`_state`) protected by a `threading.Lock`. All state transitions happen in daemon background threads.

**Version format**: `build-YYYYMMDD-N` where N is `github.run_number` (not zero-padded). Comparison uses `_parse_version()` which returns `(int(date), int(run_number))` tuples — necessary because `"9" > "14"` as strings.

**Platform behaviour**:

| Platform | ZIP structure | Updater script | Relaunch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | Files at ZIP root (CI: `Compress-Archive -Path dist\Mnemosyne\*`) | `%TEMP%\mnemosyne_updater.bat` — `robocopy /E /IS /IT` | `start "" "%APP%\Mnemosyne.exe"` |
| macOS | `Mnemosyne.app/` at ZIP root | `/tmp/mnemosyne_updater.sh` — `mv`; falls back to `osascript` admin prompt if in `/Applications` | `open "$OLD"` + `xattr -cr` to clear quarantine |

`MNEMOSYNE_APP_DIR` env var (set by `launcher.py`): on Windows = directory containing `Mnemosyne.exe`; on macOS = `Mnemosyne.app/Contents/MacOS/`.

The app exits via `os._exit(0)` (not `sys.exit`) one second after launching the updater script, to guarantee the process terminates even if FastAPI shutdown hooks are slow.

The update UI is suppressed in dev mode: `has_update` is false when `current_version == 'dev'`, and `apply_update()` raises `RuntimeError` when `IS_FROZEN` is false.

## Projects and database

Each project has its own directory (`projects/<id>/`) with its own SQLite database. The schema version is stored in `schema_version` table; migrations run at startup and are idempotent.

Database files (`*.db`) and `config.json` are not tracked by git.

---

## Relationship path export

The relationship path modal includes an **Export PNG** button. It renders the snake-layout chain to an offscreen Canvas at 2× DPI and downloads it as `relationship_<nameA>_<nameB>.png`.

- Dark (`#09090b`) background; 120 px card slots, 72 px connectors
- Each card: circular avatar (photo or initials), full name, birth–death years
- Highlight rings: violet for endpoints, rose for LCA, blue for marriage-bridge persons
- Edge labels on horizontal and vertical connectors (solid = blood, dashed = marriage)

Entirely client-side (Canvas 2D API); images are pre-loaded before drawing.

---

## Document bulk download

`POST /api/documents/bulk-download` — accepts `{ ids: number[], include_notes: boolean }`, returns `application/zip`.

The ZIP contains the original files (collisions renamed `<name> (2).<ext>`) and an optional `_index.txt` plain-text manifest with titles, types, years, linked persons, descriptions, and full note text with citations.

---

## ZIP export

A ZIP archive packages the database and all referenced media into a portable, self-contained file that can be imported on any machine.

**Contents**

| Entry | Description |
|---|---|
| `project.json` | Project name and metadata |
| `project.db` | SQLite database |
| `images/<id>_<filename>` | Included photos |
| `documents/<stored_name>` | Referenced document files |

**Export pipeline**

1. `VACUUM INTO` creates a WAL-free copy of the source database
2. **Person/cluster filter** (mutually exclusive): person list, cluster list, or full project
3. **Content toggles**: notes, sources, events, documents, images, faceless images — each independently removable
4. **Path rewrite**: image paths updated to `images/<id>_<filename>` (absolute → relative)
5. Pack with DEFLATE compression

**Import pipeline**

1. All member paths validated against project directory (Zip Slip protection)
2. Extracted to `projects/<new_id>/`
3. `project.db` → `photo_organizer.db`
4. Image paths rewritten back to absolute

**Callers**

| Caller | Scope |
|---|---|
| Project switcher | Full project |
| Clusters tab | Selected cluster IDs |
| Family tree tab | Selected subtree (`person_ids`) |

---

## GEDCOM export

Produces a ZIP with `family.ged` (GEDCOM 5.5.1, UTF-8, CRLF) and a `media/` folder.

**INDI records** — `NAME` with `/surname/`; `GIVN`, `SURN`, `NICK`, `NPFX`; vital events (`BIRT`, `CHR`, `DEAT`, `BURI`) with `DATE` and `PLAC`; `OCCU`; `NOTE`; `EVEN` (one per event); `OBJE` (documents + photos); `FAMS`/`FAMC`

**FAM records** — `HUSB`/`WIFE` (sex-aware); `CHIL`; `MARR` and `DIV` with date and place

**SOUR records** — `TITL`, `AUTH`, `PUBL`, `NOTE`, `WWW`

**Note serialisation** — Markdown stripped to plain text before writing to `NOTE` records:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `@[Name](#pid-42)` | `Name` |
| `[text](url)` | `text` |
| `## Heading` | `Heading` |
| `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `~~strike~~` | plain text |
| `` `code` `` | `code` |
| `> quote` | `quote` |
| `- list item` | `list item` |
| `[1]`, `[2]` (citation markers) | removed; appended as a list at end of note |

**Photo modes**: `none`, `primary` (one thumbnail per person), `all` (every photo the person appears in)

---

## Security

- The server binds exclusively to `127.0.0.1` — not reachable from the network
- CORS restricted to `http://localhost` and `http://127.0.0.1`
- ZIP imports are path-validated (Zip Slip protection)
- The app never sends any data to any external server; the only outbound connection is the optional GitHub update check

---

## Keeping this document up to date

- **New content toggle (ZIP)** → add row to *ZIP export* content table; update `build_export_db` in `export_utils.py`, endpoint in `main.py`, `api.ts`, `ExportModal.tsx`, and all three callers
- **New content toggle (GEDCOM)** → update *GEDCOM export*; update `build_gedcom_zip` in `gedcom_export.py` and endpoint in `main.py`
- **New note syntax** → update *Note serialisation* table; add entry to `_MD_PATTERNS` in `gedcom_export.py`
- **New data table with `person_id` FK** → update `_delete_persons` in `export_utils.py`
- **Schema change to `note_citations`** → add idempotent migration in `database.py` using the `PRAGMA table_info` + table-recreate pattern
